###Additional information about input variables
The initial data for calculation of average values come from database, which based on the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ.

*Prefix "t"* goes for time domain signals.

*Prefix "f"* goes for frequency domain signals (Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied during the initial experiments to some of the signals).

*Suffix "-XYZ"* is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

*"Jerk"* - the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals.

*"Body"* goes for body signals (from accelerometer or gyroscope).

*"Gravity"* goes for gravity acceleration signals.

*"mean()"* - were estimated the mean value from the signals.

*"std()"* - were estimated the standard deviation from the signals.
